FragRoute: Computing and Visualizing Optimal Routes for the TTSoC
=================================================================

Installation
------------
First of all, you need a recent haskell toolchain, preferably

 * `Haskell Platform <http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/>`_, version 2011.2.0.1 
 
Although the project is cabalized, you need a few additional non-haskell components

 * `The SMT solve yices <http://yices.csl.sri.com/>`_, version 1.0.28 (I use a variant with GMP dynamically linked)
 * Development packages for GTK2
 
For the solver, ``cabal install bindings-yices``, supplying the include and lib directories of the yices installation
to cabal.

For the drawing, you need the most recent diagrams package, which unfortunately is not yet released.
First, ``cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools``. Then get the latest diagrams components from
`http://code.google.com/p/diagrams/`_, and install them using ``cabal``.

If you managed to do all of this, installation is as easy as saying ``cabal install`` :)
